# TRACE-1.0
Ray Tracer Demo in JavaScript/HTML5

This is a very simple Ray Tracer which was originally written in VB .Net and ported to JavaScript. The intent was to demonstrate proof of concept and provide a baseline for a much more advanced Ray Tracer in the works. No attempt was made to follow best practices. Rather, the code is nearly a straight port from VB, so it probably breaks most best practices. Anyway, here it is for anyone who wants to see a basic from-scratch Ray Tracer that barely gets the job done.
